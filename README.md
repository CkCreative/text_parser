# Parse Text to Process Numbers

## Running

Ensure you have node installed.

run `npm start`

## Problem

I was an admin of one WhatsApp group collecting contributions towards some event. I did not want to keep updating an Excel spreadsheet all the time. Therefore, this program goes through the text file I copy pasted, finds all the numbers and prints the result.

## How it works

The sample text file is attached. It looks for a **/** symbol and extracts all the numbers into an array and then sums the array.

## How you can customise to add any numbers in a text file

You can replace the **/** symbol with any terminating symbol you used. You could even let it find a **$** sign etc.
